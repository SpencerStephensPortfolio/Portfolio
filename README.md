Firebird Graphics Engine
------------------------
The graphics engine powering "Project Firebird" (working title). This is a 3D graphics engine with advanced rendering features: full deferred shading, multi-pass lighting, HDR bloom and tone-mapping, shadow mapping, cell shading, distance-based fog, and texture UV animation. Note that this code will not run by itself, as it is dependent on private code within a project with multiple people working on it. The two small components of the engine I did not write, animation and the low-spec renderer, have not been included. Screenshots are available in the project directory.

Quadtree
--------
Demonstrative program that subdivides a quadtree data structure around a circle, which can be moved by controlled by clicking on the screen. Uses OpenGL to visualize.

WordSearch
----------
Crossword-puzzle solver written in C++. Originally written for a friend who was taking a japanese class, and needed to solve a 24 x 32 character word search puzzle. The file "wordsearch.txt" contains the puzzle, represented as tab-delimited characters spelled with roman characters.

Anagrams
--------
Uses an english dictionary file to solve anagrams. It loads this file to memory.
